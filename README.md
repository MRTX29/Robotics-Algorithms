# Robotics-Algorithms
The repository contains different algorithms written in the LUA language. The algorithms were done during the Robotics course at Universitat Politècnica de València.

Labyrinth algorithm:
The algorithm uses four LIDAR sensors and a sonar sensor to navigate inside the labyrinth. The robot chooses one of the walls (left side or right side) and follows the path. It also uses TCRT5000 IR Sensor to detect a black line on the ground which indicates the finish point.

Cinematic Control:
The algorithm uses the proportional controller to follow the predefined path.
